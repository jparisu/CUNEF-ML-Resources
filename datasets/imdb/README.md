## Preprocess

The original dataset has been preprocessed to make it easier to work with this dataset manually:

- Only films from 2008
- Only films of genre History, Sci-Fi or Comedy (only)
  - The column genre has been refactored so it only contains one of the three genres if the original one was one of them.
  - Some genres have been transformed:
    - Biography -> History
    - Documentary -> History
- `adult` column has been calculated for those values that are not `G`, `PG` or `PG-13`:
